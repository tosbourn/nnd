# Nikhilam Navatashcaramam Dashatah

Nikhilam Navatascaramam Dashatah is an algorithm which I have read about for quickly
multiplying two numbers that are close to the same multiple of 10.

You can read more about [Nikhilam Navatascaramam Dashatah](http://www.ludism.org/mentat/NumbersNearMultiplesOfTen).

I experiemented by doing some quick calculations on paper but I wanted to write
a short script that would show off the simplicity of the calculation in Ruby.

## To run

```bash
ruby run.rb
```
You will be prompted to enter one number, then a second.

You will get some put explaining the steps.
